COMPREHENSIVE BUG REPORT - Class Booking System
====================================================
Generated: December 2024

CRITICAL BUGS FIXED:
====================

1. ✅ FIXED - ADMIN AUTHENTICATION BROKEN (admin/dashboard.php:3)
   - Issue: admin/dashboard.php checked for $_SESSION['admin_logged_in'] but admin/login.php set $_SESSION['admin_id']
   - Fix Applied: Changed dashboard.php to check for $_SESSION['admin_id']
   - Impact: Admin dashboard is now accessible

REMAINING CRITICAL BUGS:
========================

2. ✅ FIXED - INCONSISTENT DATABASE CONNECTIONS
   - Issue: Multiple files create their own database connections instead of using centralized db.php
   - Fix Applied: Replaced direct PDO connections with require_once for public/api/db.php in:
     * config/user_auth.php (connectUserDB function)
     * admin/dashboard.php (statistics query section)
   - Impact: All files now use centralized database configuration for consistency

SECURITY VULNERABILITIES:
=========================

3. ✅ FIXED - CSRF PROTECTION NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Issue: CSRF tokens are defined in security.php but not used in any forms
   - Fix Applied: Implemented CSRF token verification in all forms:
     * admin/classes.php - Added token generation and verification for create/edit/delete operations
     * admin/login.php - Added CSRF protection to admin login form
     * public/login.php - Added CSRF protection to user login form
     * public/register.php - Added CSRF protection to user registration form
   - Impact: All forms now protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks

4. ✅ FIXED - NO DATE/TIME VALIDATION IN ADMIN
   - Issue: validateDate() and validateTime() functions exist but are not used in class creation
   - Fix Applied: Added proper date/time validation in admin/classes.php:
     * Integrated validateDate() function for date input validation
     * Integrated validateTime() function for time input validation
     * Added server-side validation for both create and edit operations
   - Impact: Invalid dates/times are now rejected with proper error messages

5. ✅ FIXED - NO INPUT LENGTH LIMITS
   - Issue: No maximum length validation for text inputs
   - Fix Applied: Added comprehensive input length limits:
     * admin/classes.php - Added maxlength attributes and server-side validation for class name (100), description (500), capacity validation
     * admin/login.php - Added maxlength for username (50) and password (255)
     * public/login.php - Added maxlength for email (100) and password (255)
     * public/register.php - Added maxlength for all text inputs including health questionnaire fields
     * Added visual indicators showing character limits to users
   - Impact: Prevents buffer overflow and UI breaking with extremely long inputs

CODE QUALITY ISSUES:
=====================

6. ✅ FIXED - MISSING ERROR LOGGING
   - Issue: Exceptions are caught but not logged for debugging
   - Fix Applied: Added error_log() calls to all catch blocks across the application:
     * admin/classes.php - Added logging for class creation, update, deletion, and loading errors
     * admin/dashboard.php - Added logging for database errors
     * admin/login.php - Added logging for login errors
     * admin/bookings.php - Added logging for booking-related database errors
     * config/user_auth.php - Added logging for user registration and login errors
     * public/login.php - Added logging for public login errors
     * public/register.php - Added logging for registration errors
     * public/api/db.php - Added logging for database connection failures
     * public/api/classes.php - Added logging for class fetching errors
     * public/api/class.php - Added logging for single class fetching errors
     * public/api/book.php - Added logging for booking processing errors
   - Impact: All exceptions are now logged for easier debugging in production

7. HARDCODED ADMIN CREDENTIALS WARNING
   - Severity: MEDIUM
   - Issue: Default admin credentials (admin/admin123) should be changed
   - Impact: Security risk if not changed in production
   - Files: Database setup
   - Fix: Force password change on first login

POTENTIAL RUNTIME ERRORS:
=========================

8. ✅ FIXED - NO CAPACITY VALIDATION
   - Issue: Class capacity can be set to 0 or negative numbers
   - Fix Applied: Proper capacity validation is already implemented in admin/classes.php:
     * Line 50: Validates capacity > 0 in create form validation
     * Line 56: Additional specific check with error message "Capacity must be greater than 0"
     * Line 81: Validates capacity > 0 in edit form validation  
     * Line 87: Additional specific check with error message "Capacity must be greater than 0"
     * HTML form includes min="1" max="999" validation
     * Error message now uses standardized ErrorMessages::INVALID_CAPACITY
   - Impact: Class capacity cannot be set to 0 or negative numbers, ensuring booking logic works correctly

9. ✅ FIXED - MISSING FILE EXISTENCE CHECKS
   - Issue: Include statements don't check if files exist
   - Fix Applied: Added file_exists() checks before all include/require statements:
     * templates/base.php - Added checks for header.php and footer.php
     * public/index.php - Added checks for config.php and base.php
     * public/login.php - Added checks for user_auth.php, security.php, config.php, base.php
     * public/register.php - Added checks for user_auth.php, security.php, config.php, base.php
     * public/logout.php - Added check for user_auth.php
     * public/test_auth.php - Added checks for user_auth.php, config.php, base.php
     * public/example_standalone.php - Added checks for config.php, header.php, footer.php
     * admin/classes.php - Added checks for auth.php, db.php, security.php
     * admin/login.php - Added checks for db.php, security.php, config.php, base.php
     * admin/bookings.php - Added checks for auth.php, db.php
     * admin/dashboard.php - Added checks for security.php, config.php, db.php, base.php
     * config/user_auth.php - Added check for db.php
     * public/api/classes.php - Added check for db.php
     * public/api/class.php - Added check for db.php
     * public/api/book.php - Added checks for db.php and user_auth.php
   - Impact: Application now gracefully handles missing files with proper error logging and user-friendly error messages

MINOR ISSUES:
=============

10. ✅ FIXED - INCONSISTENT ERROR MESSAGES
    - Issue: Some error messages are generic, others are specific
    - Fix Applied: Implemented centralized error handling with standardized messages:
      * Created config/error_handling.php with ErrorMessages class containing consistent error messages
      * Updated admin/classes.php to use standardized error messages (ErrorMessages::CSRF_INVALID, ErrorMessages::NAME_TOO_LONG, etc.)
      * Updated admin/login.php to use standardized error messages (ErrorMessages::LOGIN_FAILED, ErrorMessages::REQUIRED_FIELDS, etc.)  
      * Updated public/api/classes.php to use ErrorMessages::apiError() and ErrorMessages::apiSuccess() for consistent API responses
      * Updated public/api/book.php to use standardized API error responses
      * All error messages now follow consistent format and terminology
      * Added helper methods for formatting HTML and API responses
    - Impact: Consistent user experience with standardized, professional error messaging across the application

11. ✅ FIXED - NO PRODUCTION ERROR HANDLING
    - Issue: No error_reporting configuration for production
    - Fix Applied: Implemented comprehensive production error handling system:
      * Created config/error_handling.php with environment-based error reporting configuration
      * Production mode: error_reporting(0), display_errors=0, errors logged to logs/error.log
      * Development mode: error_reporting(E_ALL), display_errors=1, full error details shown
      * Environment detection via config/environment.php or APP_ENV environment variable
      * Custom error handler that suppresses technical details in production
      * Custom exception handler that shows generic messages to users in production
      * Automatic logs directory creation
      * Created config/environment.example as template for environment configuration
      * All files now include error_handling.php for consistent error behavior
    - Impact: Production sites will hide technical error details from users while logging them for debugging, improving security and user experience

12. MISSING HTTP SECURITY HEADERS
    - Severity: MEDIUM
    - Issue: .htaccess has some security headers but missing CSP
    - Impact: XSS vulnerability potential
    - Files: public/.htaccess
    - Fix: Add Content-Security-Policy header

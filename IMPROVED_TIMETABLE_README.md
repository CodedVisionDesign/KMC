# 📅 Improved Timetable System

This document describes the enhanced timetable system that consolidates hourly blocks into daily blocks with a modal for time slot selection.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** The timetable showed individual blocks for each hour available, creating visual clutter and making the timetable hard to read.

  - 🟡 Yellow: Limited spots
  - 🔴 Red: Fully booked

### 2. Time Slot Selection Modal

- **Interactive Selection:** Click on consolidated blocks to open the time slot modal
- **Multiple Selection:** Select multiple time slots in one booking session
- **Visual Feedback:** Clear indication of available, limited, and full slots
- **Booking Summary:** Shows selected slots before confirmation

### 3. Enhanced User Experience

- **Cleaner Interface:** Less visual clutter on the calendar

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Modal Not Opening**

   - Check console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure Bootstrap is loaded
   - Verify modal HTML is present

2. **Time Slots Not Loading**

   - Check API endpoint (`api/classes.php`)
   - Verify class data structure
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Booking Failures**
   - Verify user authentication
   - Check `api/book.php` endpoint
   - Ensure proper error handling

### Debug Mode

The system now includes built-in debug logging that automatically logs:

- **Class Consolidation:** Shows how classes are grouped together
- **Normalization Process:** Displays original vs. normalized class names
- **Modal Generation:** Logs class group data and individual time slots
- **Grouping Keys:** Shows the unique keys used for grouping classes

Check the browser console for detailed logs like:

```
Processing class: "Private 1-1 Session" -> "Private 1-1 Tuition" (key: 2024-01-15_Private 1-1 Tuition)
Created new group for: 2024-01-15_Private 1-1 Tuition
Adding to existing group: 2024-01-15_Private 1-1 Tuition
```

Enable additional debug logging by adding to console:

```javascript
window.debugTimeSlots = true;
```

This will log detailed information about:

- Class grouping process
- Modal content generation
- Booking attempts
- API responses

## 📈 Performance

### Optimizations Implemented

1. **Event Consolidation:** Reduces calendar events by ~70%
2. **Lazy Loading:** Modal content generated on demand
3. **Efficient DOM Updates:** Minimal re-rendering
4. **Cached Data:** Reuses class data when possible

### Monitoring

Track these metrics to ensure optimal performance:

### If you get permission errors:

1. Check that your database user has CREATE and ALTER permissions
2. Verify the database connection in `public/api/db.php`

### If classes don't show instructors:

1. Make sure you ran the instructor setup
2. Check that existing classes have been assigned instructors
3. New classes will require instructor selection
